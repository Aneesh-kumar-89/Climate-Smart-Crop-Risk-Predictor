# Climate-Smart-Crop-Risk-Predictor
Core Idea  Input = Weather forecast (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind) + crop + growth stage.  Output = Risk score (Low / Medium / High) of crop damage in the coming week.
This one has both zero-budget feasibility and huge real-world impact since farmers face crop loss from unpredictable climate changes every year.

Example Flow:
👩‍🌾 Farmer inputs: Rice, 30°C avg, 80% humidity, 200mm rainfall forecast. 
🤖 Model predicts: High Risk – Flooding likely. Suggest water drainage.

Why This Is Unique
* Most plant AI apps only look at leaf images.
* I am  combining climate + crop stage to predict disaster risk before it happens → preventive solution, not reactive.
